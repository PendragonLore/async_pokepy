    Attributes
    ----------
    id: :class:`int`

    name: :class:`str`
        The name of the berry.
    growth_time: :class:`int`
        The time it takes the tree to grow one stage, in hours.
        Berry trees go through four of these growth stages before they can be picked.

        The firmness of the berry, used in making PokÃ©blocks or poffins.
    soil_dryness: :class:`int`
        The speed at which the berry dries out the soil as it grows.
        A higher rate means the soil dries more quickly.
    flavors: List[:class:`BerryFlavorMap`]
